# learning_bioinformatics
This repo contains simple exercises I completed whilst learning bioinformatics on my own


1. counting_base_pairs.py -- This is a simple function that counts the number of base pairs in a given sequence.
2. count_base_pair_percentages.py -- This is a simple function that returns the percentage of each base pair
3. complementary_base_pairs.py -- This is a simple function that returns the complement of  a sequence of base pairs
